# Important notes

- You can complete this exercise in i) Colab or ii) on your local machine
  1. **Colab**: When you finished the exercise, download the file: `File` > `Download` > `ipynb`
  2. **Local**: Activate the appropriate conda environment before you start.


- Don't change the name of the file or folders and don't delete any cells.


- Make sure you fill in any place that says  <font color='green'> \# YOUR CODE HERE </font> or "YOUR ANSWER HERE", as well as your HdM ID as NAME.

- The function **NotImplementedError()** prevents you from hand in assignments with empty cells. Simply delete the function if you start working on a cell with this entry.


- Before you turn this problem in (i.e., after you completed all tasks), make sure everything runs as expected: Restart the kernel and run all cells. If you use:
  - *Visual Studio Code*: select "Restart" and then "Run All" 
  - *Colab*: in the menubar, select `Runtime` and click on `Restart and run all`
  - *Jupyter Notebook*: in the menubar, select `Kernel` and click on `Restart & Run All`

- You need to hand in the files in their respective folders in Moodle

Good luck!
